              Paper jam checks for the current product are executed at the beginning of the next product.\n
              But when there is no product following the current product this parameter allows you to define a timer.\n
              Started after finishing the current product after the expiration of this time the paper jam checks are executed.\n
              A value of 3000 means that 3 seconds after the last product a paper jam check is executed.\n

  retraction_distance_during_reference:
    name: "Sheet Retraction Distance before Reference move [mm]"
    comment: |
              This parameter configures the retraction distance of the sheet before reference move.
              Therefore it is possible to avoid sheet snippets (and resulting paper jams).
              The value is given in Millimeter.
              Default value is 1.5-times the value of parameter 'Distance of blade'.
              Smaller values will be ignored.

  source_parameter_working_velocity:
    name:     "Parametersource for conveyor velocity"
    comment:  |
              This parameter defines the programme parameter whose value will be used to determine the conveyor velocity.


              0:   Line velocity
 
              12:  Weighing velocity
              14:  Line velocity


              Nevertheless the velocity value  will be internally validated.

             Factor for activation point of roll brake.
             
             
             If active, roll brake will be activated beneath lower loop position. This parameter allows to move this activation point towards the upper loop position. Movement is given in percent and relates to the distance between lower and upper loop position.
