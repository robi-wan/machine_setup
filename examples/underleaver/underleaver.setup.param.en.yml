              Paper jam checks for the current product are executed at the beginning of the next product.\n
              But when there is no product following the current product this parameter allows you to define a timer.\n

  source_parameter_working_velocity:
    name:     "Parametersource for conveyor velocity"
    comment:  |
              This parameter defines the programme parameter whose value will be used to determine the conveyor velocity.


              0:   Line velocity
 
              12:  Weighing velocity
              14:  Line velocity


              Nevertheless the velocity value  will be internally validated.

             Default: 1.

  
  factor_activation_point_roll_bracket:
    name:   "Factor activation point rollbracket"
    comment: |
             Factor for activation point of roll brake.
             
             
             If active, roll brake will be activated beneath lower loop position. This parameter allows to move this activation point towards the upper loop position. Movement is given in percent and relates to the distance between lower and upper loop position.

  decrease_simulated_portions:
    name:   "Factor for reduction of simulated portions"
    comment: |
            This parameter configures a factor which can decrease simulated portions.
            This factor is used for calculation the distance between two simulated portions.
            This factor differently influences the count of simulated portions because
            the calculation of simulated portions depends on sheet length and conveyor velocity.


            With a value of 0 the maximum number of portions will be simulated.
            The given value will be interpreted as decimal with one decimal place:
            value 25 will be interpreted as 2.5.
            Increasing this parameter by 10 can (depending on sheet length and conveyor velocity)
            reduce the number of simulated portions between 10 and 20 percent.

  length_correction_first_sheet_after_insert_sheet:
    name: "Length correction for first sheet after 'Insert Paper' [mm]"
    comment:  |
          Correction for length of first sheet after insert paper.
          A constant length difference of first sheet after insert paper can be compensated with this value.
          Subsequent 'insert paper' operations will use this correction value for sheet positioning.

          Value is given in millimeter.

  dancer_pressure_algorithm:
    name: "Algorithm for pressure calculation of dancer"
    comment: |
          This parameter configures the algorithm used for pressure calculation of dancer.
          The dancer will be moved down with the calculated pressure.
          These values are possible:


          0: Linear equation
          1: Quadratic equation
          2: Polynomial of 5th degree

          
          Besides the used algorithm the values for lower and upper loop position and maximum pressure of
          pressure regulator influence dancer motion.

  blade_rotate_proof_installable:
    name: "Blade rotate-proof installable"
    comment: |
          Is the blade rotate-proof installabel?


          0: No, blade is not rotate-proof installable. It can be installed with a rotation of 180 degree.
             After lowering the cutting unit the drives need to find their reference positions.
          1: Yes, blade is rotate-proof installable.
             After lowering the cutting unit the drives does not need to find their reference positions.

  blade_velocity_ratio:
    name: "Velocity Ratio conveyor vs. blade [%]"
    comment: |
          This parameter configures the velocity ratio between conveyor and blade.
          Value is given in percent.
          Angabe wird als Prozent interpretiert, um die sich das Messer beim Schneiden schneller drehen
          soll als das Band.
          Values smaller than 30 will be ignored.
          The maximum blade velocity is always respected.


          Example: If value is 30, blade's velocity during cut is 30 percent higher than conveyor's velocity.
          In order to let the blade cut with maximum velocity a large value - like 2000 - is needed.


          Default: 30.
