                Setting for reference initiator of blade drive.
                This setting is for compensating different reference initiator positions.
                You have to adjust this setting until the correct position of blade drive is reached.
                Correct position means: half-moon is on the right hand side and blade holding fixture screws are horizontally alined.

                Positon of Blade Scanning Sensor relative to Grinding Point in extended state.


                Value is given in tenth of millimeter
                Example: Value 1550 will be used as 155 millimeters.

                Value is given in tenth of degree.


                Example: Value 100 will be used as 10 degree.

                Configure the used mode for referencing the angle grinding drive.
                This is especially useful if this drive has a MultiTurn-Encoder.


                0: Move drive until torque reached
                1: Teach drive position (only effective with multiturn drive)
                

                Attention: When changing reference mode do not forget to adjust parameter 'Reference Angle Grinding Angle Drive'.

    comment:    |
                Configure the difference between given grinding angle and actual grinding angle measured at blade.
                Value is given in tenth of degree. Given value stands for measured difference.
                The range of valid values starts at -5.0 and ends at +5.0.


                Example: Programme parameter for grinding angle is 22 degree.
                Measured grinding angle is 22.8 degree. The difference of the grinding angle is therefore 0.8 degree.
                The value of this setup parameter has to be 8.

                
                Example 2: A difference of -2,3 degree has to be entered as -23.

              0: Drive doesn't exist.
              1: Drive exists as a servo.
              2: Drive exists as a frequency converter.
